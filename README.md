# Nelumbo

It's Filecoin on your computer. 

Nelumbo is a development tool designed to help build Filecoin storage clients faster. Rather than spending time dealing with CLI issues and things you'd rather leave to the DevOps team, you can use Nelumbo to run a local, development version of the Filecoin blockchain. 

One-click install. Automatic updates. It's all there. 

### To Run Locally 

1. Clone the repository.
2. `npm install` 
3. `npm run dev`
